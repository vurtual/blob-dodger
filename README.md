BLOB DODGER

A simple, and totally misnomered game where you are a blob (a paint splat really) and you have to avoid balls. 
Balls bounce on the walls, but you can go through them. 
Score points by surviving, blobs get destroyed when they are hit by a ball.
Every time you hit 500, 1500, 2500 points etc, a new ball appears.
Every time you hit 1000, 2000, 3000 points etc, a new blob appears. Your new blob moves in parallel to your existing blob
so if you move up, it moves up, if you moove left it moves left, and always at the same speed.
Your score imcrement increases with each new blob, so that's good, right? But of course, it does mean the balls arrive quicker all the time!
You lose a life once all your blobs been destroyed by the balls.
Occasionally, you might see a big blob outline. That is a powerup. Collect it to briefly becaome a ball eater
You get 1000 points for eating a ball, but of course, every 1000 points, a new blob and a new ball appear!

Music is just a placeholder for now, and sound effects are coming soon.
